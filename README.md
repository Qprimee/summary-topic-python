# summary-topic-python

request to a few sites, get p tags and extraction text </br>
and then with text rank get some best sentence of that </br>
with python </br>

for example, we request three sites to << what is tea >>
and we extracted long text about tea and it has repetitive sentences </br>
but with the text rank algorithm, we get some best sentences

you can change sites and the number of significant sentences returned

todo :
* auto search in some sites like Wikipedia,cnn,bbc, and ... 
* make API for this with Flask
